### What
A basic implementation of a ray-tracer using Java and following the pattern outlined in [Ray Tracing From the Ground Up](http://www.raytracegroundup.com/).
The implementation is still incomplete and I plan on getting back to it eventually and building out some additional features.


### Why
I think computer graphics are pretty interesting, and a neat intersection of computer science and mathematics. Plus, as amazing as a console
application may be, there is always something to be said for the value of actually seeing something take place on screen.
